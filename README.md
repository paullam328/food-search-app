# FoodSearchApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

This Angular project contains two components - search and map.  Search component subscribes to the REST API service that fetches data from the SQL database, while map components generate the Google Map as a variable.

## SQL server
Run `npm start` on the server\app.js.  The server will be set in `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
